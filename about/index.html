    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
    Useful Links is a small personal project where I collect websites I genuinely
    find useful, interesting, or just nice to have bookmarked in one place.
    </p>

    <p>
    The goal of this site is simplicity. No accounts, no tracking, no algorithms, 
    just a curated list of links that I actually use myself.
